### _I. The theorem of the Low-density parity-check code(LDPC code)._

[This section is used to explain the theorem of the LDPC.](https://github.com/davidfathers119/CUDA-install-guide/issues/1#issue-3694868277)

### _II. The table of the code in [LDPC 5G](https://docs.nvidia.com/aerial/archive/cuda-accelerated-ran/24-1/pyaerial/aerial.phy5g.ldpc.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com#)._
[This section is used to list all the code in the LDPC 5G document and the parameter.](https://github.com/davidfathers119/CUDA-install-guide/issues/2)

###  _III. The relationship about the code and the theorem._

[This section is used to explain the connection about the theorem and the code.](https://github.com/davidfathers119/CUDA-install-guide/issues/3)
